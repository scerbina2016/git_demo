Dansing queen, only seventin 
you can dans, you can jail 
in all you time of you life

Many, many, many
Always sunny
In the richmen world

Wind of change

Lasciatemi cantare
Con la chitarra in mano
Lasciatemi cantare
Sono un italiano

i cross a stream,
i have a dream

You should meet my at five o'clock
